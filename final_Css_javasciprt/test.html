        Not possible, because box-shadow is generated based on the entire boundary of the element â€” you can't select which boundaries you don't want the shadow to be computed... unless you are willing to set a negative offset on the y-axis:

      box-shadow: 0 -19px 19px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
      But that will mean that the shadow will be larger on the top. Another way is to obscure the shadow at the bottom with a pseudo-element, but that presents several problems:

      Your background will have to be of solid, uniform colour (patterns will mismatch)
      The shadow will end abruptly at the bottom
      The CSS for this fix would be as follow (you might have to adjust the pixel values if you change the shadow blur size).

      div:after {
          background-color: #fff;
          height: 20px;
          content: "";
          position: absolute;
          bottom: -20px;
          left: -20px;
          right: -20px;
      }
      See proof-of-concept example below:

      body {
        padding: 50px;
      }

      div {
        margin: 0 auto 50px auto;
        width: 50%;
        height: 50px;
        box-shadow: 0 5px 19px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
        position: relative;
      }

      div::after {
        background-color: blue;
        height: 20px;
        content: "";
        position: absolute;
        bottom: -10px;
        left: 0px;
        right: 0px;
      }
    </style>
